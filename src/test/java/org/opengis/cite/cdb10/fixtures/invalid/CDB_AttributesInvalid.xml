    <Attribute code="1" symbol="AEAC" deprecated="true">
      <Name></Name>
      <Description>
        A unique numeric identifier that points to the entry number of the ATARS Extended Attribution file for the
        current dataset.
        This entry is provided for legacy database generation facility considerations only; CDB-compliant devices are
        not required to read and interpret this field.
        The ATARS Extended Attribution file should be located in the same directory as the instance-level attribution
        file.
        An empty AEAC field (i.e., null string) is allowed.
        Refer to Section 3.6.6, Tiled Datasets Folder Hierarchical Organization for the file naming conventions of
        vector datasets.
        NOTE: The AEAC is attribute is deprecated as a result of the more comprehensive Extended-level attribution
        schema introduced in version 3.1 of the CDB Specification.

    <Attribute code="2" symbol="AHGT">
      <Name>Absolute Height Flag</Name>
      <Description>
        Indicates how to interpret the Z component of a vertex.
        If AHGT is true, the feature is positioned to the value specified by the Z component (Absolute Terrain
        Altitude), irrelevant of the terrain elevation dataset.
        If AHGT is false or not present, the feature is positioned to the value specified by the underlying terrain
        offset by the Z component value.
        Refer to section 5.6.1.1, ShapeFile Type Usage and Conventions for more details.
        AHGT can be present only in datasets using PointZ, PolylineZ, PolygonZ and MultiPointZ Shape types.
        AHGT should not be present for all other Shape types or must be ignored otherwise.
        Refer to Appendix A – "How to Interpret the AHGT, HGT, BSR, BBH, and Z Attributes" for additional usage
        guidelines.
        NOTE: It is recommended that the AHGT flag be set to false because it facilitates the creation of CDB datasets
        that are independent of each others.
        When the Z coordinate (altitude) of a feature is relative to the ground, the terrain elevation dataset can be
        updated without the need to recompute the altitude of the feature.
        CAUTION: When the AHGT flag is set to true, the feature will be at a fixed WGS-84 elevation independently of the
        terrain LOD selected by the client-device.
        As a result, there is no guarantee that the feature (and its modeled representation) will remain above the
        terrain skin across all terrain LODs.
        RECOMMENDATION: Limit the use of AHGT=TRUE to data whose source is inherently absolute.
        Such source data include geodetic marks or survey marks that provide a known position in terms of latitude,
        longitude, and altitude.
        Good examples of such markers are boundary markers between countries.

    <Attribute code="3" symbol="AO1">
      <Name>Angle of Orientation with greater than 1 degree resolution</Name>
      <Description>
        The angular distance measured from true north (0 deg) clockwise to the major (Y) axis of the feature.
        If the feature is square, the axis 0 through 89.999 deg shall be recorded.
        If the feature is circular, 360.000 deg shall be recorded.
        Recommended Usage. CDB readers should default to a value of 0.000 if AO1 is missing.
        Applicable to Point, Light Point, Moving Model Location and Figure Point features.
        When used in conjunction with the PowerLine dataset, AO1 corresponds to the orientation of the Y-axis of the
        modeled pylon.
        The modeled pylon should be oriented (in its local Cartesian space) so that the wires nominally attach along the
        Y-axis.
        Refer to Appendix A – “Creating a 3D Model for a Powerline Pylon” for additional usage guidelines.

    <Attribute code="4" symbol="APID">
      <Name>AirPort ID</Name>
      <Description>
        A unique alphanumeric identifier that points to a record in the NavData Airport or Heliport dataset (i.e., a
        link to the Airport or the Heliport description in the NavData dataset).
        This ID is the value of the field Ident of the Airport or Heliport dataset.
        Note that all of the lights located in list-organized datasets that are associated with the operation of an
        airport (including runway lights and lighting systems) are required to reference an airport or heliport in the
        NavData dataset.
        All man-made features associated with an airport or heliport must be assigned an APID attribute; the APID
        attribute is not required for features unrelated to airports or heliports.
        Usage Note: Recommended for all Airport Light Points and airport-related i2DModels (such as runway/taxiway/apron
        surfaces, and markings).
        Failure to appropriately tag airport culture with APID attribute will result in reduced control of
        airport-related culture by simulator.
        Optional for Location Points, Environmental Light Points, and Moving Model Location features that fall within
        the confines of an airport and for which control of the feature is desirable.
